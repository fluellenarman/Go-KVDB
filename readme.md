# Go KVDB

Go KVDB is a learning project for me to refresh on some database fundamentals.
In addition, I also plan on implementing Raft Consensus into Go KVDB

## Goals
1. Create a key value store in Go
    - Hashmap implementation
    - Persist data in binary JSON
    
2. Transition Go kvdb a DBMS 
    - create CRUD API's for IPC
    - create a TKINTER GUI for local management
    - Concurrenct/prevent race conditions
    - Transaction based Atomicity

3. implement Raft Consensus to make it a distributed database
